  chore(ci): add run_tflint_check.sh for consistent TFLint execution

- Created `run_tflint_check.sh` to standardize TFLint installation and execution across local and CI/CD environments
- Ensures the script runs from the project root for correct `.tflint.hcl` detection
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use `run_tflint_check.sh`
- Renamed workflow step to "Install and run TFLint and Generate Report" for clarity
