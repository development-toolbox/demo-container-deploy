  refactor(ci): unify report upload logic for TFLint & Trivy scans

- Added `upload_report()` function to `run_trivy_scan.py` (same as in `run_tflint_check.py`)
- Ensured Trivy report is uploaded before failing the workflow
- Standardized exit codes:
  - ðŸš¨ Exit 1 if Trivy detects HIGH vulnerabilities
  - âœ… Exit 0 if no HIGH vulnerabilities are found
- Reduced duplicate logic between TFLint and Trivy scans
- Improved workflow badge accuracy (red if vulnerabilities/issues are found)
- added commit-* to .gitignore
