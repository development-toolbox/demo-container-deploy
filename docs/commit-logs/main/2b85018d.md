  fix(ci): ensure TFLint and Trivy jobs fail on errors, append reports to original commit

- Updated Terraform CI/CD (`terraform-ci.yml`) to fail if TFLint detects issues
- Ensured Trivy job exits with an error when vulnerabilities are found
- Updated Terraform CI/CD to creates a `tflint_report.md` file with tflint issues if found
- Reports (`tflint_report.md` and `trivy_report.md`) are now appended to the original commit
- Prevents unnecessary new commits, keeping commit history clean
